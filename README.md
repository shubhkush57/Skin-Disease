## Overview
Skin diseases can have a significant impact on a person's health and wellbeing. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for preventing complications, scarring, disfigurement, and even life-threatening conditions such as skin cancer. This project aims to develop an image classifier that can accurately identify common skin diseases in images uploaded by users and also gives them functionality for searching disease.

## Data Source
We specifically employed the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset as a cornerstone in our project. This dataset, released by us, played a pivotal role in augmenting the academic machine learning landscape within dermatology.

## Focus Diseases
The dermatoscopic images are sourced from various populations and captured and stored using different modalities. The resulting dataset comprises 10,015 dermatoscopic images, categorized into seven distinct classes of skin cancer listed below:


-	Melanoma
-	Melanocytic nevi
-	Benign keratosis-like lesions
-	Basal cell carcinoma
-	Actinic keratoses
-	Vascular lesions
-	Dermatofibroma
